# BoilerHunt-v2

This project was made to help new students at Purdue University to familiarize themselves with the expansive campus. It has objectives 
throughout the campus that students have to reach and once they have reached it, the phone will prompt them that they have met their objective and will
remove it from the list of objectives they have to do. 

## Technology utilized
This project utilizes React Native, ExpressJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, location tracking, React native maps library, Tailwind CSS

## Initial Setup
To start the mobile app, you first have to change directories to Client
```
cd client
```
Next run the command 
```
npm start
```
The terminal will prompt you with options to display your app. For testing purposes select ios or i. The app should launch and you will be met with the initial home screen. When clicking on the Objectives butttons you will notice that nothing is visible. That is because we have to start the backend server. To start the backend server go to the BoilerHunt-Backend repository and follow the set up instructions. After starting the backend the app will run correctly.
